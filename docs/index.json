    "keywords": "Introduction Whether you are creating a traditional RPG, a roguelike, an MMO, or even a game with unique mechanics, Simple RPG Core can adapt to your needs. By providing a robust framework for managing attributes, statistics, levels, classes, and more, it allows you to focus on the creative aspects of game development, simplifying the implementation of the more monotonous parts with a scalable and maintainable 100% inspector-driven experience. The possibilities are endless, unleash your creativity. Vocabulary of Simple RPG Core The package is developed around the concept of entity, so let's clarify what we mean by this term in the context of Simple RPG Core. In its most minimal version, an entity is a GameObject that has a set of statistics. Optionally, an entity can have attributes, can level up, and can have a class. Let's clarify what we mean by each mentioned term. Statistics (Stat) A statistic is a value that quantifies an aspect of the entity. The meaning of this aspect is solely due to the concept it refers to. Examples In an RPG, a statistic can be physical damage. The concept of physical damage refers the player to the amount of damage inflicted by physical attacks, whether with weapons or without. Other statistics can be ability power, defense, speed, armor penetration, range, etc. Attributes An attribute is a value that can influence the value of one or more statistics. The weight of its influence on the statistics can be variable. Examples In an RPG, attributes can be: strength, dexterity, intelligence, constitution, etc. Considering the previous example of statistics, strength could influence physical damage, dexterity would increase speed, intelligence would increase ability power, and constitution would increase defense. Experience and Level The entity can gain experience and level up. This functionality is used by the class to express how attributes and statistics grow with levels, for that particular class. Class The class is associated with a set of statistics and optionally a set of attributes. The class describes how statistics and attributes vary with levels. Examples In RPGs most common classes are: warrior, rogue, mage, paladin, and so on. These classes have different attribute values. For example, a warrior will have more strength and constitution than a mage. The rogue might have the highest dexterity, etc. How is Simple RPG Core organized and how does it work? Entity A GameObject becomes an entity once the EntityCore and EntityStats MonoBehaviours (Mono) are added to it. EntityCore comes with a built-in EntityLevel (plain C# class) that manages the experience and the level of the entity. Stat A Stat is a class that derives from ScriptableObject (SO) and represents a statistic in the game. Each statistic has a name (the name given to the SO instance of the created Stat), and we can choose whether to provide it with a maximum and/or minimum value. Additionally, we can define how that statistic grows or is reduced, depending on certain Attributes. StatSet A StatSet is a class that derives from SO and defines a set of Stats. EntityStats EntityStats allows us to configure: the base statistics the flat modifiers the StatToStat modifiers the percentage modifiers We will see what these modifiers are in the section (TODO). The base statistics can be fixed, or instead derive from a class if the entity has one assigned. If we use the fixed ones, we must also provide a StatSet, while if we use those of a class, the class's StatSet will be used. If the entity levels up and we want its statistics to grow with levels, we are forced to use a class, as the fixed statistics are immutable. Class Class derives from SO and represents a game class. Each class has a name, a GrowthFormula that defines how the base Max HP grows with levels, a StatSet, optionally an AttributeSet, and associates each Stat of the provided StatSet with a GrowthFormula that describes how the statistic varies with levels. Similarly, if an AttributeSet is provided, it will be possible to associate a GrowthFormula for each Attribute present in the set, to describe how the attributes vary with levels. EntityClass EntityClass derives from Mono and allows us to assign a Class to our entity. Attribute An Attribute is a class that derives from SO and represents an attribute in the game. Each attribute has a name and, like statistics, can have a maximum and minimum value. AttributeSet An AttributeSet is a class that derives from SO and defines a set of Attributes. EntityAttributes Optionally, we can add the Mono EntityAttributes to our entity if we want to give it attributes. EntityAttributes allows us to specify how many attribute points to provide at each new level. These points can be spent on various attributes to increase their value. For EntityAttributes we can configure: the base attributes the flat modifiers the percentage modifiers Similarly to EntityStats, we can decide whether the base attributes are fixed or if they instead derive from the class associated with EntityClass. Growth Formula To express how Stats, Attributes, Max HP, and the experience required to level up vary at each level, we can use instances of GrowthFormula. This is a class that derives from SO and allows us to define a mathematical function, or a system of functions, that describe how a value changes as levels increase. We will see in more detail how to define a GrowthFormula in (TODO). How is Simple RPG Core implemented? The package is developed following the principles of SOAP (Scriptable Object Architecture Pattern), and has been inspired by the GDC talk of Ryan Hipple. In a nutshell, the main benefits provided by this architecture are: encapsulation: separation of game logic from data. Game logic code shouldn't mix with data. All data is nicely wrapped withing SO instances game designers friendly: game designers can make changes and balancements from the inspector without touching the code greater reusability: Each object is a ScriptableObject that can be reused by many components greater testability: being data separated from code, is easier to isolate and fix bugs. Moreover, SO events can be raised with ease at the press of a button from the inspector interface, easing and speeding up debugging even further. Flexibility of Simple RPG Core Although the package is specifically designed for RPG games or games with progression systems, its flexibility allows it to be used in almost any game. As it allows creating attributes like strength, dexterity, agility, etc., and statistics such as physical attack, magic power, physical defense, etc., in RPG, Roguelike, MMO games, etc., nothing prevents it from being used, for example, to implement a firearm. The attributes could be weight, size, ergonomics, etc., and the statistics recoil, handling, stability, intimidation, etc. Attributes can influence statistics. A heavier weapon could reduce handling but increase stability. A larger weapon could reduce handling but increase intimidation. A more ergonomic weapon could reduce recoil and increase handling. And so on... The weapon's levels, if present, influence the attributes and statistics, progressively improving them. Classes could represent weapon types (assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, etc.), and each class could have its own set of dedicated attributes and statistics. For example, shotguns could have, in addition to the aforementioned ones, the barrel length attribute that influences the pellet spread statistic."

    "keywords": "Workflows Some utilities Almost every class provided by this package uses events or variables in the form of ScriptableObject. Therefore, let's quickly introduce these concepts so that we are clear about what we are talking about when we encounter them in the following paragraphs. Game events as ScriptableObjects The SOAP architecture allows us to implement the Observer pattern through scriptable objects. In the simplest case, with events without context, we can define various game events as GameEvent instances: a class that derives from ScriptableObject. For example, we can create an instance called PlayerJumped that represents the event \"The player has jumped\". This event will notify all listening systems when it occurs. Systems subscribe to this event using the MonoBehaviour GameEventListener. We can assign a GameEvent to this component, and it will handle the subscription and invoke a callback when the event is triggered. The callback is a UnityEvent, so we can select a callback to invoke in response to our event directly from the inspector. For more details, see the Game Events section. Int and Long Vars Another common use of ScriptableObject in the SOAP architecture is to define variables. The main advantage of these variables in the form of SO is that they can be easily shared between various objects that may decide to share the same value. A common example is the player's game score. There could be a game manager that adds or removes points from this variable, while the UI HUD uses it to display its value on the screen. This way, we can keep the game manager and UI completely decoupled, passing shared values (like variables) through the inspector. Int and Long Refs IntRef and LongRef allow choosing whether to use a native value (int or long) or an IntVar/LongVar. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, IntVar and LongVar have the advantage of being shareable between different components/game objects, while native values are more immediate to use and require less setup (no need to instantiate an IntVar/LongVar and assign it in the inspector). Make a GameObject an entity To make a GameObject an entity, we need to add the MonoBehaviour EntityCore to it. Select your object from the hierarchy and click, in the inspector, on \"Add component\". Then search for and select EntityCore. (TODO) Add image of the entity core From the inspector, we can configure a series of values. Let's analyze them one by one. Level: defines the level of the entity. By changing its value, we can assign a different level to the entity directly from the inspector. This can be useful for testing purposes. You will notice the Use Constant checkbox. If checked, you can pass an IntVar instead of using a constant. Current Total Experience: Represents the total experience possessed by the entity. This value cannot be modified. Growth Formulas As already mentioned in Introduction, GrowthFormula allows defining how a certain value varies as levels increase. A GrowthFormula can be instantiated through the hierarchy context menu by going to Simple RPG Core -> Growth Formula. The package provides a custom property drawer for GrowthFormula. For more details, see the Growth Formulas section. Make a GameObject an entity To make a GameObject an entity, we need to add the MonoBehaviour EntityCore to it. Select your object from the hierarchy and click, in the inspector, on \"Add component\". Then search for and select EntityCore. (TODO) Add image of the entity core From the inspector, we can configure a series of values. Let's analyze them one by one. Level: defines the level of the entity. By changing its value, we can assign a different level to the entity directly from the inspector. This can be useful for testing purposes. You will notice the Use Constant checkbox. If checked, you can pass an IntVar instead of using a constant. Current Total Experience: Represents the total experience possessed by the entity. Being this a LongRef, you can choose whether to use a const value (a native long), or a LongVar instead. Game events The package also supports game events with up to 4 context parameters. They are generics, but in Unity, it is not possible to instantiate classes that derive from ScriptableObject if they are generics with unspecified type parameters. To use them, we must explicitly declare classes that derive from the generic GameEvent and fix the type parameters with concrete types. To simplify the definition of new event types, with specific types as context parameters, the package provides GameEventGenerator. These generators, which derive from SO, allow generating the concrete classes of GameEvent. We will see these generators in more detail in the section (TODO). Some game events are already defined and made available by the package (see the Samples page). Int and Long Vars Int and Long Refs IntRef and LongRef allow choosing whether to use a native value (int or long) or an IntVar/LongVar. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, IntVar and LongVar have the advantage of being shareable between different components/game objects, while native values are more immediate to use and require less setup (no need to instantiate an IntVar/LongVar and assign it in the inspector). Thanks to a custom property drawer, it will be possible, from the inspector, to check a checkbox named Use constant to use a native value instead of a Ref, and vice versa. IntRef and LongRef are widely used in the package's MonoBehaviour. Growth Formulas As already mentioned in Introduction, GrowthFormula allows defining how a certain value varies as levels increase. A GrowthFormula can be instantiated through the hierarchy context menu by going to Simple RPG Core -> Growth Formula. The package provides a custom property drawer for GrowthFormula. Max level for the values In the inspector of a GrowthFormula, we can pass an IntVar to define up to which level to grow the values. Use constant at level one If the checkbox named Use constant value at level 1 is checked, the respective constant value will be used. Growth equations The various values of the GrowthFormula are defined by a function where values, the y-axis, are expressed in function of the levels, the x-axis. Such function is defined as a system of equations. Each equation is a string that associates a math expression to a range of levels. The string can be defined by using the Unity ExpressionEvaluator syntax. On top of it, the following terms can be used: LVL: the level at each iteration PRV: the previous value of the GrowthFormula (value evaluated at the previous level) SPRV: the second previous value of the GrowthFormula (value evaluated 2 levels ago) SUM: the sum of the values of the GrowthFormula from level 1 up to the previous level Make a GameObject an entity To make a GameObject an entity, we need to add the MonoBehaviour EntityCore to it. Select your object from the hierarchy and click, in the inspector, on \"Add component\". Then search for and select EntityCore. Image - Entity Core Custom Editor From the inspector, we can configure several values. Let's analyze them one by one. Level: defines the entity's level. By changing its value, we can assign a different level to the entity directly from the inspector. This can be useful for testing purposes. You'll notice the Use Constant checkbox. If checked, you can pass an IntVar instead of using a constant. Current Total Experience: Represents the total experience possessed by the entity. Warning If you've passed a LongRef for the current total experience, the value contained in this variable should not be modified manually. If Use constant is checked instead, the value is readonly. Max Level: The maximum level the entity can reach Experience Formula: GrowthFormula that describes how the total experience required to reach the next level grows at each level. On Level Up: IntGameEvent that should be raised when the entity levels up. Spawned Entity Event: EntityCoreGameEvent that should be raised when this entity's Start() method is executed. You may notice that a game event is already assigned to Spawned Entity Event. This is because an instance of that game event has been explicitly assigned directly in the inspector of the EntityCore script. This choice was made since in most cases the same event instance will always be used for entity spawning. This means you don't have to reassign this event every time you create a new entity in Unity. As we'll see later, this default assignment mechanism has been used for other components as well. Creating Simple RPG Core assets All the instances of the various assets that derive from ScriptableObjects can be created in the following ways: Context menu: Right click on the hierarchy > Create > Simple RPG Core Top bar: Assets > Create > Simple RPG Core Hotkeys: By pressing the respective keyboard shortcut while a folder or an element of the hierarchy is currently selected Note For Mac users the Ctrl key corresponds to the Cmd key. Create attributes Keyboard shortcut: A Relative path: Attribute Once created a new attribute you can name it as you wish and you'll be able tweak some settings in the inspector. For example lets create a Strength attribute. Create an Attributes folder in your hierarchy, then press A and name the newly created attribute Strength. In the inspector it should look like: By checking Has Max Value, we will set a maximum value for the attribute. By default, there is no maximum value. By checking Has Min Value, we will set a minimum value for the attribute. By default, the minimum value is zero. Repeat the process for also the Constitution, Intelligence, and Dexterity attributes. Create an attribute set Keyboard shortcut: Alt + A Relative path: Attribute Set Now that we have some attributes let's create an AttributeSet named, for example, Hero Attribute Set. In the inspector it should look like this: An attribute set without attributes isn't very useful, so let's add the previously created ones, one at a time. To do this, click on the Add button. Notice that an entry with None (Attribute) appears: To assign an attribute to the entry, we can either drag&drop from the hierarchy or click on the small circle button on the right of the newly appeared entry. This mechanism is the same used for public variables or, more generally, for fields annotated with SerializeField, so it will be familiar to you. Let's add Strength using whichever method you prefer. Repeat the process of adding an attribute to the set for Constitution, Intelligence, and Dexterity as well. If you want to remove an attribute from the set, you can click on the small - button on the right of the attribute you want to remove. Add EntityAttributes to an entity The next step is to assign the attribute set we created to an entity. To do this, let's add the EntityAttributes component to our game object. The inspector will look like this: An entity has base points for attributes, which can be either fixed or derived from a class, a configurable amount of attribute points that can be arbitrarily assigned, and these points are granted at each level-up, along with flat and percentage modifiers for the attributes. Except for the modifiers, which can only be assigned via code, all other values can be configured from the inspector. Attr Points Per Level defines how many arbitrarily spendable attribute points are provided at each level-up. They are assigned starting from level 2 on. Attribute Points Tracker allows monitoring and assigning spendable points. Available Points defines how many unspent points are still available. If you change the level of the entity you'll see that available points change accordingly. And as you spend them, Available Points will decrease. Moreover, there is a checkbox labeled Use Class Base Attributes. For now, let's leave it unchecked since we haven't added a class yet. However, in this case, we need to manually assign an attribute set. Therefore, let's set the Attribute Set field found under Fixed Base Attributes with the Hero Attribute Set. By doing this, we now have access to additional fields in the inspector: We can assign values to the attributes of Fixed Base Attributes as we see fit. Create stats Keyboard shortcut: S Relative path: Stat As with attributes, you can create stats as you wish and assign them the names you prefer. Let's create the Physical Attack stat together. Create a new Stats folder, select it and press S. Name it Physical Attack. In the inspector, it should look like this: As with attributes, you can assign both a maximum and a minimum value to a stat. Repeat the process for the Magical Power, Physical Defense, and Critical Chance stats. Unlike attributes, however, stats include Attributes Scaling. Create an Attribute Scaling Component for Stats Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + A Relative path: Scaling -> Attribute Scaling Component Let's create a new Attribute Scaling Component to use with the strength stat we created earlier. Create a new folder named, for example, Attribute Scalings for Stats, and inside it, create an attribute scaling component called Physical Attack Strength Scaling. Assign the previously created Hero Attribute Set to the Set field. You will see the attributes of the set appear. Here, you can assign scaling values using double. For example, set the scaling of Strength to 1.0. This component defines a 100% scaling on the value of Strength. Now, assign this scaling component to the Physical Attack stat to ensure it scales with the Strength attribute. Create a StatSet"
